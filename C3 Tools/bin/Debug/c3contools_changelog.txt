FEATURES / CHANGE LOG:

v3.9.4
SETLIST MANAGER
- Added ability to quickly add the RB1, Green Day, RB3 and Blitz export songs to a RB4 setlist with one click. When RB2, Lego and AC/DC are made available by Harmonix they will automatically download from the server and be available as well. To add any of these, you must be in RB4 Mode, click on the Rock Band 4 menu and then select the export to add
- Added ability to export the filtered list of songs to .Setlist format (File -> Export as .Setlist) - this allows you to curate a specific list of songs that you can then share with others. You can still export to PDF, Excel and CSV formats as before by going to File -> Export As...
- Added ability to import a .Setlist file - if you drag/drop or go to File -> Load existing Setlist, Setlist Manager loads that on its own.  This new feature (File -> Import .Setlist file) will combine the songs in the .Setlist file being imported with your existing songs

----------

v3.8.1
EVENT MANAGER

- Re-arranged tools to reflect how I believe they are being used and how they should be used

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Made optional the step that removes all *.png_xbox files after converting the CONs - this is disabled by default since it shouldn't be needed anyways - enable it under Options

- Just drag and drop the files, click Bundle, bam - but please do read the help documentation included!

VIDEO PREPARER
- One of the restricted tools only available to C3 Authors before is now available to the public!
- You can use this to package songs that you will be recording - you get one pack, with all artists changed to 'Video Recording' so they're all grouped together in game, with unique song ids and track numbers to avoid in-game conflicts AND with custom songs.dta editing that makes multitrack audio not mute, so you can record a multitrack song without worrying about audio dropping out

- Added feature that will fix most of the typical artist/song name encoding problems (i.e. remove weird characters caused by wrong DTA encoding)
- Changed behavior so when exporting setlist using Detailed 1, Detailed 2 or Detailed 3 PDF formats while Sorted By Artist, each Artist's songs are sub-sorted alphabetically (same behavior as in Basic 1 and Basic 2) rather than the random entry order in the song cache
- Added option to only write the artist name once when exporting setlist using Detailed 1, Detailed 2 or Detailed 3 PDF formats while Sorted by Artist 
- Fixed bug that would tell you you had to unlock the program even when it was unlocked if you exited via File -> Exit

- Added option to select from two methods of MIDI to EDAT encrypting - if a song you converted tells you 'Unable to load...skipping', try changing the encrypting under Options to Type 2 and try converting again

----------

v2.7.0
ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Given all the recently and newly added (see below) features, it's no longer appropriate to call it "Album Art Converter", so renamed it
- Added ability to extract textures from your Rock Band 3 save game file. Drag and drop the file to Advanced Art Converter. Bam. Instantly get your character pictures as well as custom art you have created in the game's art creator
- Added support for more texture types and expanded support to all Rock Band games and expansion packs, the Rock Band music store app, and all Dance Central games
- Added ability to copy the current folder to directory or paste a directory to search in. Just right-click on the folder text box at the top
- Added feature that will remember last directory used and default to it if it still exists next time you run the program
- Fixed bug that would cause all images to be shifted slightly to the right
- Greatly reduced and improved the code for higher efficiency and accuracy in the conversion process

SAVE FILE IMAGE VIEWER (NEW!)
- Found in Advanced Art Editor -> Advanced
- Allows you to view your character pictures as well as custom art you have created in the game's art creator
- All three consoles are supported - see HELP doc for more information
- You can export all images by going to File -> Export all images or by clicking on the respective image's Export image button
- Five backgrounds are included for your character. If you want to change them, replace "bg1.png", "bg2.png", "bg3.png", "bg4.png" or "bg5.png" in the /res folder. To export a composite image of your character on the selected background, right click and choose "Export composite image"
- The code for editing and replacing of images is there, but disabled since the game continues to say the file is corrupt. Hopefully someone else can pick up where I left off and finish it. For now, EDITING IS DISABLED. ONLY VIEWING/EXTRACTING IS ENABLED.

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added support for Rock Band Blitz song cache files ("Library Files") - Xbox 360 ONLY (not quite sure if PS3 has a cache for it)
- To import a Blitz cache, go to File -> Import RB Blitz song cache. You can also add "blitz" to the name of the cache file and then drag and drop it. If you try drag/drop without having "blitz" in the filename it will fail, since it will assume it's a RB3 cache file
- There are some limitations: Blitz does not keep track of a few fields that RB3 does, so we don't have gender (defaults to Male), master status (defaults to being a master), song length (will show as 0:00), rating (defaults to NR), track number (defaults to 1)
- Fixed a couple of potential bugs for more stability

PACK EXPLORER
- Fixed bug introduced when this tool was strictly for Rock Band use which would change the game ID of any CON file opened to Rock Band 3 by default if it wasn't another Rock Band title - now can open, edit and save CON/LIVE files from other games without affecting the game ID
- Made the Visualize button only show up when the program can find a songs.dta file in the CON, otherwise it's not a Rock Band song and can't be Visualized

WII CONVERTER
- Fixed bug that would create a corrupt VENUE track, which in turn would cause playability issues with some songs
- Added option to enable/disable the conversion of the venue from RBN2 to RBN1 (enabled by default)
- Added option to enable/disable the conversion of post processing events (enabled by default)

VISUALIZER
- One more bug fix for using our default font. It was requiring you had Myriad Pro default installed, not just the included Myriad Pro Bold. Fixed

GENERAL
- Fixed behavior throughout to avoid issues of files being in use when the program scans for CON files

----------

v2.6.1
PS3 CONVERTER
- Changed method used to make the EDAT files to a more reliable and efficient tool = less failures, more consistency, less clutter

VISUALIZER
- Added option to pick between Myriad Pro (default), Calibri, Tahoma and Times New Roman fonts
- Changed behavior when our default font is not installed or accessible = program will keep running and you can just choose a different font
- Simplified ability to use a custom font = create a text file named font.txt and place it in the /res folder. Enter one line of text that says FontName=Name Here and save it. Visualizer will load that and make it default, but you can still choose any of the other fonts mentioned above. Make sure the font name is spelled correctly (case sensitive) and is actually installed on your system.

MIDI CLEANER
- Fixed multi-threading call bug that would cause the program to fail (introduced in v2.5.1)
- Cleaned up files being left behind when cleaning a CON file

- Added ability to make form background transparent. Combine it with borderless and hide the banner = free-floating buttons!

----------

v2.6.0
- Since it's been brought up so many times and the program no longer resembled Le Fluffie in any way, we've renamed to C3 CON Tools. 
MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE YOUR SHORTCUTS TO POINT TO C3CONTools.exe! That includes changing the path in Magma: C3 Roks Edition under ADVANCED SETTINGS.

PS3 CONVERTER (NEW!)
- Customs come to PS3! (Requires jailbroken PS3, see included Help Documentation)
- Allows you to very quickly batch convert CON/LIVE files into PS3 format
- Allows you to merge already-converted songs with your existing customs (i.e. files downloaded from C3's database)

ALBUM ART CONVERTER
- Increased in-game album art quality exponentially (about 8x the image data) - now creates 512x512 DXT5 textures instead of prior 256x256 DXT1 textures when converting to png_xbox or png_ps3 
--- As of this writing, Magma: C3 Roks Edition isn't updated to accept these files natively. Refer to the updated tutorial on the Magma: C3 Roks Edition thread on how to get these higher quality album art files into your song
- Increased quality of images converted from png_xbox/png_ps3 (also noticeable in Visualizer)
- Added support for most Rock Band game textures (besides the usual album art files) - can be converted from *.png_xbox or *.png_ps3 to *.png, *.bmp, *.jpg and/or *.dds. No guarantees are made that it will work with all game textures from all Rock Band games, but over 3,000 textures from RB3 and TB:RB have been tested and worked
- Added support for input images in Targa format (*.tga)
- Removed ability to resize images on the fly when converting from png_xbox/png_ps3/png_wii - this yielded lower quality than doing so afterwards on Paint.NET or Photoshop, and allows for otherwise overall better quality as mentioned above

SETLIST MANAGER
- Fixed bug caused by old songs having Track Number 0 that would cause the Information panel to stop showing song information
- Fixed bug where certain songs would have ridiculous rating numbers that would cause the program to crash
- Fixed bug where files would not refresh when drag/dropping one Setlist after having another Setlist already opened
- Greatly improved error handling and notification during loading of the Setlists

BATCH EXTRACTOR
- Fixed bug that had broken ability to use with Pro Upgrade CONs

v2.4.4
QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Added option to dePACK packs into individual songs with one click. Each CON file will retain the same game ID as the original pack (i.e. RB1/RB2/RB3) and will be named Artist - Song. By default the CON files will use the song's album art file as thumbnail, user can change this to use the pack's thumbnail image.

MIDI CLEANER
- Expanded ability to clean CON/LIVE files. Same behavior as before - drag/drop one or multiple CON/LIVE files or use the "Browse..." button to find them. Can only combine CON/LIVE files with MIDI files. LIVE files will be changed to CON and unlocked/made anonymous in the process. No packs or pro upgrades.

----------

v2.4.3

- Added PS3 support! Can now convert to and from *.png_ps3 images
- Minor behavior changes to logging

MIDI CLEANER
- Fixed cleaning of incorrectly formatted lyrics, now it detects all instances and fixes them correctly
- Added check to existing BEAT track for back-to-back downbeats
- Modified code to ensure creation of BEAT track does not generate back-to-back downbeats
- Added check for 1/x time signatures ... since these are so rare, user will be notified as a warning of a possible mistake in the tempo map
- Expanded persistent options to include whether to override note velocities, the note velocity value, whether to correct notes that are too short, and what size to change them to

VISUALIZER
- Added support for PS3 (*.png_ps3) images for album art
- Changed behavior when reading the MIDI file to estimate if the file is Expert-Only. If the program determines it most likely is Expert-Only, you'll be shown why it thinks so and you can choose whether to mark is as Expert-Only or not.

GENERAL
- Improved code in all instances where CON/DTA files are imported/processed to expand compatibility with RB1 era files

----------

v2.4.1
MIDI CLEANER
- Added finding and moving of [music_start] event if it's earlier than two beats from the start of the track
- Added option (enabled by default) to create a BEAT track for the MIDI if one is not present already - this is highly accurate for most songs, but it may fail if there are irregularities in the MIDI file (i.e. very rare but possible, mostly very old files) - songs with 11/16 and similarly "weird" time signatures may need thinning of the BEAT track to match the "feel" of the song
- Added cleaning of lyrics with either # ^ & markers at the start of the lyric, now will be moved to the proper placement (as the last character of the lyric)
- Added option to display total number of issues fixed broken down by instruments (on by default when Detailed Logging is enabled)
- Greatly improved reporting accuracy when using [M:B:T] format during detailed logging (i.e. easier to find the problems in REAPER)
- Fixed code to ensure all tracks finish with an EndTrack event (just for a healthier MIDI file, no changes in behavior for RB3 purposes)
- Adjusted code so a "clean" copy isn't exported when nothing is actually cleaned in the MIDI
- Fixed bug that would not save clean MIDI to the right directory if MIDI Cleaner was opened via command-line or Magma
- Fixed bug that would sometimes report wrong notes twice when the MIDI was using running status
- Fixed bug that would report the uncapitalized lyrics without specifying the track name

WII CONVERTER
- Added code to convert unsupported RBN2 venues into supported RBN1 venues = working camera cuts and lighting calls! 
- This takes place automatically when converting an existing CON to Wii format, or you can click on 'Extras' -> 'Convert VENUE from RBN2 to RBN1' and you can process MIDI files for songs you've already converted. You can do one or multiple MIDI files at a time this way.

BATCH RENAMER
- Added option (enabled by default) to sort expert only songs separately when "Try detailed sub-sorting" is enabled. For songs created with Magma: C3 Roks Edition this is picked up from the DTA file. For other songs this is estimated based on the charts found in the MIDI file.

BATCH EXTRACTOR (previously DTA EXTRACTOR)
- Expanded from only extraction of DTA files to include MIDI, MOGG and MILO_XBOX files
- Can extract one or all of the file types above from one or multiple CON/LIVE files at once
- Still uses all the renaming features present before, each file type is grouped in its own folder
- For PNG_XBOX (album art) files, continue to use ALBUM ART EXTRACTOR

PACK CREATOR
- Several bug fixes and code changes to eliminate (or at least reduce) the "access to folder denied" errors reported that would cause the process to fail

PRO UPGRADE BUNDLER
- Added some code to improve loading of some MIDI files that may not have loaded before due to format errors

GENERAL
- Enabled running multiple instances of the program
- Enabled opening of MIDI Cleaner by drag-dropping a MIDI file to the main form

v2.4.0
MIDI CLEANER (NEW!)
- Feature to batch process old RB/GH/FoF/PhaseShift MIDIs to get them as close to RBN 2.0 compliance as possible via automation.
- MIDI Cleaner will NOT make an old RB/GH/FoF/PhaseShift MIDI ready to compile in Magma, but it will reduce a lot of the time you have to spend cleaning it up.
- MIDI Cleaner can be opened via command-line two ways: use -cleaner as an argument to open MIDI Cleaner, or use the file path to a specific MIDI file to open it automatically. This also means you can do Right-Click -> Open With and select C3 CON Tools
- For the extensive list of features included refer to the Help in MIDI Cleaner

QUICK PACK EDITOR (NEW!)
- Finally one of the most requested features is here! This allows you to quickly modify a pack of songs in two ways:
You drag and drop or browse for a pack, the program reads it, shows you all the songs it finds. Select all the songs you want to remove, leaving the ones you want to keep in the new package. Don't worry, you have plenty of opportunity to change your mind. Then you choose
1) Edit DTA entries only - the songs will be removed from the songs.dta file, so in game they will no longer show up. This is much quicker but leaves you with the same file size pack
2) Edit DTA entries and pack contents (default) - will remove the songs from the songs.dta file as well the associated files in the package. This is the preferred method but takes considerably longer
- If you want to go a little further, you can also change the title and description text, the package and content thumbnails (what you see in this program and the Xbox dashboard), and the game ID in case you want to change it (default value is whatever game ID the input file had)

QUICK DTA EDITOR (NEW!)
- Feature to quickly open and edit the DTA file (controls all metadata in the song)
- Drag and drop a song/pack file, or use the 'Open file' menu option. The DTA file is automatically extracted and opened in Notepad, you make your changes, exit out and click Yes to save. The modified DTA file is replaced and the song/pack file is saved as a signed, unlocked CON file ready for your Xbox

VISUALIZER
- Added option to use custom overlays for holidays and other special moments. You need two files, one called "theme_overlay.png" and one called "theme_button.png" - replace "theme" with the name of your holiday or whatever you want. Place those two in the /res folder. Visualizer includes six preset themes: Christmas ("xmas"), Valentine's Day ("love"), St. Patrick's Day ("stpaddy"), Summer ("summer"), Independence Day ("freedom") and Halloween ("spooky"). When making your own, use the included themes as reference. Your files must match the dimensions of the included themes and be .png (with transparency). Then in Visualizer you or anyone you share the files with clicks on the lock and enters the name of your theme, and voila. If you named your files "valentines_overlay.png" and "valentines_button.png", the password would be "valentines" in Visualizer. C3 Authors must make sure to get admin approval if they're planning to use any custom designs.
- Fixed bug where expert only chart that was also marked as X-Only in Magma would show two X-Only icons
- Fixed annoying bug where every time you typed into the Name or Artist fields it would always scroll to the end

BATCH RENAMER
- Fixed bug where some special characters would end up in the file name, which the Xbox would not accept
 
PACK CREATOR
- Small code changes to hopefully eliminate the random crashes after building a pack using a thumbnail from one of the cons in the pack
- Fixed bug where input files would be counted incorrectly and lead to incorrect "duplicates" message

PRO UPGRADE BUNDLER
- Fixed bug that had broken ability to use pro upgrade con

WII CONVERTER
- Added option to replace non-working .milo_wii files with a working basic one from an official song. It is not a perfect solution but it gives you some sort of camera cuts and lighting effects, rather than a static camera. This option is only available when doing Smart Folder Merge. 

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Added option to replace the genre with the song's subgenre. Note that Phase Shift does NOT support subgenres, so this replaces the genre with subgenre in the song.ini file, not add both.

----------

v2.3.5
VISUALIZER
- Added ability to use TIFF (*.tif), GIF (*.gif) and DDS (*.dds) images for the album art
- Added Halloween and Christmas overlays if you want to theme your Visualizer images...these will only show up in the months of October and December respectively

GENERAL
- No longer using Tao.DevIL.dll or ILUT.dll (you can safely remove them if you still have them, no longer included with the program files)
- Greatly improved image handling to avoid crashes and more efficient processing
- Testing different way to enlarge/shrink images, let me hear your opinion! Better? Worse? The same? (= better because cleaner code).

----------

v2.3.3
VISUALIZER
- Added ability to display song rating (FF = Family Friendly, SR = Supervision Recommended, M = Mature, NR = Not Rated)
- Enabled auto-loading of Author Logo at run-time. Name it "author.png" (224x33 pixels) and place it in the program directory. This image goes in the small rectangle at the bottom of the album art.
- Changed behavior to account for long album names to shorten and add ellipsis (...) rather than have the text go off-screen 
- Changed behavior to replace "feat." and "featuring" with the much shorter "ft." to save space and generate text at an easier to read size
- Greatly improved the SPLIT behavior for better splitting and text resizing after splitting
- Fixed bug that would allow Genre/Sub-Genre to be moved up even when there was existing Album Name text
- Fixed bug that would show both Rhythm on Keys / Rhythm on Bass icons when importing a song that was compiled with the Rhythm on Bass marker in Magma.
- Other minor improvements

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER

- Added two C3 thumbnails. Use them when creating packs of C3 customs!

GENERAL
- Cleaned up the installation folder of all .dll and .exe files
- Other minor fixes

----------

v2.3.1
VISUALIZER
- Added ability to estimate whether a song is Expert-Only based on the contents of the MIDI charts. This should be "pretty good" at determining whether there are "some" reductions, not whether the reductions are done to any standard. Still, tests show a 90%+ accuracy. If you want more details as to what is and isn't in the MIDIs, you might want to use the MIDI Tester feature that will be available in Magma: C3 Roks Edition v2 soon.

CON EXPLORER
- Fixed bug that would cause a crash when extracting a file via right-click menu. TIP: You can extract files by drag/dropping them to your desktop/folder!
- Fixed bug where if you replaced a file by drag/dropping it, the form would not reflect that changes had occurred

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Cleaned up how the song.ini file is created to remove unused fields and modify some fields from old FoFix format to current PS format - thanks to AkiraNomuraBCN for the help!
- Added C3 icon to each song archive and necessary line to the song.ini file. You'll need to copy the C3 icon to your icons folder. Thanks to AkiraNomuraBCN for the suggestion.

- Quickly and accurately converts CON/LIVE files to Phase Shift format - all the features that Phase Shift supports that are present in the CON are preserved!
- Only step you have to do manually is separate the mogg into individual ogg files - program can automatically send the mogg to Audacity for you
- Program can automatically RAR each converted song if you want to share them - will automatically append _phaseshift to each RAR archive
- By default, C3's banner (banner.png in the program directory) is included with Phase Shift songs, change that with another image if you'd like your own banner
- By default, the loading phrase is set to "www.customscreators.com" - to change it create a text file, name it loading_phrase.txt and place it in the program directory, enter anything you want to show up as your loading phrase in there

PACK CREATOR
- Added Thumbnail Viewer feature - will display the Package Image thumbnails for all the files loaded prior to building the pack - up to the first 100 files loaded. Just drag the thumbnail you want to either the Package Image or Content Image boxes

- Hopefully fixed all instances of the code where user could not delete a folder/file until closing the program down
- Added ability to open Wii Converter directly in the desired folder by passing the argument as -wii -folderpath - future update to Magma will use this

----------

v2.2.2
WII CONVERTER
- Added option to clear contents of folder before starting to avoid duplicates/file conflicts
- Fixed bug where preview start time would only show 1:0 instead of 1:00
- Fixed bug where song name was incorrectly determined for non Magma-created songs
- Fixed bug where if the process failed for one song it would stop the entire conversion process

----------

v2.1
PRO UPGRADE BUNDLER (new!)
- allows for easy and quick bundling of songs with their pro upgrade - drag and drop the song, drag and drop the upgrade con or upgrade files, press Bundle...that's it! The songs.dta and upgrades.dta files are combined, the song's midi and the upgrade midi are combined, song is rebuilt as "filename_bundled". Your original files are not edited.
- Added -probundler argument: add it to your shortcut after the .exe: ...C3CONTools.exe" -probundler and the program will bypass the main screen and go straight to the Pro Upgrade Bundler

PACK CREATOR
Fixed several bugs pointed out by C16 (thanks!)...now it should work as intended:

----------

v2.0.0 RC2
VISUALIZER
- Added option to include user logo...must be PNG image up to 224x33 pixels (or smaller). Click on the clear rectangle (bottom of the album art) to select an image. Click on it again to drag your logo to where you want it. Right click and select "Clear logo" to remove the logo.

v2.0.0 RC1
BATCH RENAMER (NEW!)
- Allows you to rename and/or sort your files in a batch!
- Enable 'Rename files' if you want your files to be renamed (enabled by default) - can choose from four formatting options: "The Artist - Song", "Artist, The - Song", "Song - The Artist" or "Song - Artist, The" - renaming works by grabbing the artist and song from the songs.dta file for single songs (99%+ accurate?) - for pro upgrades and packs, it uses a bit of logic based on naming conventions and patterns (~90% accurate)
- If you want to replace blank spaces in your file name with underscores, select that option before clicking Begin ('Rename files' must be selected)
- Whether you're renaming or not, enable 'Try to sort files' to do basic top level sorting = sorting of the files based on established naming conventions - will sort to "pro_upgrades", "hmx_dlc", "c3_dlc", "rbn", "ghtorb3", "beatles" and "pony_rock"
- Enable "Try detailed sub-sorting" if you want to have sub-sorting into "rb1" and "rb2" subfolders (rb3 content stays in main sorted folder), and then finally "packs" or "albums"
- Will also find duplicates! - default behavior is to append (2)(3), etc - select 'Delete older copies' to delete files with older "last modified on" dates with the same internal file name (i.e. v3 of a song for which you have v4), select "Delete exact copies ONLY" to delete files with same name, file size and "last modified on" date (i.e. exact duplicates of a file) - duplicates are sent to your Recycle Bin rather than deleted from your hard drive, so you can restore your files if something went wrong

DTA EXTRACTOR (NEW!)
- Allows you to batch extract the songs.dta files from CON/LIVE files very quickly
- Provides several naming options so the files aren't all named "songs.dta" - 5 different naming options available

- Added ability to read subgenre from song. Can only display genre OR subgenre, click on the the one you want to show
- Added ability to overwrite font size...will always auto-size first, then you can enlarge or shrink the Song Title, Artist Name and/or Song Duration
- Added ability to split Song Title or Artist Name into two lines - just type the whole thing, then click on "Split": Visualizer will try to split as close to the middle of the phrase as possible without splitting a word. Click on "Join" to go back from two lines to one line
- Added ability to move the Song Title and the Artist Name - just click on the arrows and move the mouse around. This works with both one-line and two-line names
- Added ability to change font color individually for each component of the image! Just click on the color bar next to the name of the field (i.e. next to Song Title)
- Added ability to lower/raise the Year - it will be aligned to the Album Name or the Genre (this is useful for longer album names that typically overlap the Year)
- Changed previous restriction so Song Duration can now show up to 7 characters (i.e. 1:23:45) since the new Magma allows us to go beyond an hour
- Changed and improved code that reads song duration from songs.dta to take into account 60 minute+ songs
- Changed and improved drag-and-drop code - can now drop an image anywhere on the form and it will be assigned to the album art, and can drag and drop a song (CON or LIVE) anywhere on the form, including on the previously-restricted album art box and it will be loaded and processed
- Greatly improved uploading code: if fails will ask if want to retry, and can handle user input
- Changed default uploading / saving behavior: default is now to just upload to Imgur without making a local copy, you can check off "Local" to also save to your hard drive, uncheck "Imgur" if you ONLY want to save a local copy and not upload it to Imgur automatically
- Changed uploading behavior: link is copied to clipboard automatically but browser won't open unless you click on the link
- Changed the tiering behavior to show pro guitar/bass/keys difficulties when present rather than their 5-lane counterparts
- Added ability to read new metadata saved by Magma: C3 Roks Edition (whether song is karaoke, multitrack, expert-only, etc)
- Added field to show you who the author of the song is (if they're using Magma: C3 Roks Edition)
- Visualizer will try to make an educated guess as to whether the song is official DLC from HMX, from RBN or one of the GHtoRB3 tracks
- Added ability to interpret the contents of the Song Title: if the Song Title contains (RB3 version) (Rhythm Version) or (2x Bass Pedal), it will automatically select the appropriate icon(s) and remove it from the Song Title for you for a cleaner image
- Added ability to save / load 'Visualizer Profile' = saves the colors and font sizes for each component, so you can set your color scheme, save it, and load it at any time. Once you load a profile, that will become the "default" values until you close Visualizer (hint: you can distribute a custom Visualizer Profile with your custom skins)
- Reworked the font loading process: if "font.otf" or "font.ttf" are found in the 'res' folder, it will default to that (hint: this can be used to distribute a custom font with your custom skins), if not, it will default to the included c3.otf font. If the chosen font is not already installed, Visualizer will open it for you and prompt you to install the font. The program will close, run it again after installing the font and you will be good to go...PLEASE NOTE that not all fonts will work well with Visualizer's auto-size feature and GDI+ graphics drawing method. If your font doesn't play nice, you can still use it but you must set the size manually
- Improved code that verifies the song is not a pack - Visualizer no longer needs to extract the pack to determine it has more than once song inside
- Added small graphic to let you know Visualizer is loading when drag-n-dropping a large CON file (takes a few seconds)
- Changed the look to match the new "look"

PACK CREATOR
- Changed encoding for the songs.dta files - they now are encoded using UTF8 encoding and the line "encoding 'latin1'" is replaced with "encoding 'utf8'" - this should resolve most of the non-standard character issues caused by previous Packager
- Improved the option to use an existing folder structure (i.e. previously extracted and prepared pack) - Click on 'Advaced' -> 'Use existing folder structure' - YOU MUST SELECT THE SONGS FOLDER (i.e. "songs\yoursong\" - select the songs folder)
- If you load the Packager, and there were previously extracted files, and you accidentally click "No" (so it deletes and starts from scratch), your folder is moved to the Recycle Bin rather than deleted from your hard drive, so you can restore it
- Enabled changing the Content Image (previously locked) and switched order of images to make more sense
- Can now drag and drop images to both image fields
- When changing either the Content Image or the Package Image, defaults to included folder of images provided by C16 (THANKS!)
- Several major code improvements
- Changed the look to match the new "look"

ALBUM ART CONVERTER
- Several code improvements and general cleanup
- Changed the look to match the new "look"

CON EXPLORER

- Added ability to add new files to existing package either by drag and dropping the files into the bottom panel, or right click and choose 'Add file(s)'
- Added ability to replace file by drag and dropping over the existing file in the bottom panel (can only replace file with same filetype - i.e., .mid with .mid, etc)
- Removed "option" to add new folder since it was never coded to work
- File sizes now display in KB or MB, so it makes more sense than looking at size in bytes
- Added option to change game ID from and to RB1, RB2 and RB3 - ONLY USE THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
- Changing game ID will automatically change Content Image to match
- Enabled changing the Content Image (previously locked) and switched order of images to make more sense
- Can now drag and drop images to both image fields
- When changing either the Content Image or the Package Image, defaults to included folder of images provided by C16 (THANKS!)
- Extracting package now creates a "header_info" text file with all of the useful information and none of the useless information it generated before
- Considerable code improvements
- Re-created the form from scratch to break away from the constraints of the old Le Fluffie DevNet controls and changed the "look"

CON CREATOR
- Added ability to drag and drop entire folders [on the left panel] ... files inside the folder are automatically added as well. If it's a song folder structure, the "gen" subfolder and those files will also be added...if "songs.dta" is present, it will also be added
- Added ability to drag and drop files [on the right panel]
- Added option to change Game ID to Rock Band, Rock Band 2, and Rock Band 3 (default) - when changing ID the Content Image will automatically change for you to match
- Enabled changing the Content Image (previously locked) and switched order of images to make more sense
- Can now drag and drop images to both image fields
- When changing either the Content Image or the Package Image, defaults to included folder of images provided by C16 (THANKS!)
- Fixed deleting folders ... before it would seem as if it was deleted, but was still in the package
- Fixed deleting of multiple files: select the ones you want to delete, right click on any of them, delete. Bam, works as intended.
- Removed option to rename files/folders. It was messy and didn't always work well. Just make sure files/folders are named correctly before you add them.
- Major code improvements and clean-up
- Re-designed most of the form to break away form the old Le Fluffie "look" and only give you what you need for Rock Band purposes

GENERAL
- now accepts arguments! This means you can create shortcuts with one of the following arguments and it will bypass the main screen and go straight to that form, which saves you time if you only ever use the Visualizer, for example. Valid arguments are "-visualizer" "-artconverter" "-packcreator" "-renamer" "-artextractor" "-dtaextractor" and "-songpackager". Only one argument per shortcut. Add it to your shortcut after the .exe: ...C3CONTools.exe" -visualizer
- program can now be opened via command line with the file path to a CON/LIVE file as the argument - will open in Song Explorer (now used by Magma: C3 Roks Edition!)
- Re-envisioned the "look" of the program - new modular look that will allow for further expansion rather than the already crowded drop-down menu system
- Miscellanous code improvements

X360 LIBRARY
- No longer using x360.dll, but instead imported only the relevant parts of the source code, cleaned it up, and fixed some parts that had problems...this may mean further improvements down the line as I fix up the library.
